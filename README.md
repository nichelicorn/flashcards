## Install/Setup instructions
* To play FlashCards, clone this repo by clicking the `‚¨á Code` button, and choosing your clone path.
* In your terminal, input the command `git clone [remote address]`
* Once the repo is installed, change into the directory to install necessary dependencies. Run the command `npm install`
* Once you have installed the repo, run `node index.js` from the root of the project, and the game will begin.

## How to play the game
The first question will appear with a list of possible answers. The user selects an answer by inputting a number on the keyboard 1Ô∏è‚É£ 2Ô∏è‚É£ 3Ô∏è‚É£, or by using the up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and down ‚¨áÔ∏è arrow keys and keying "enter" ‚èé when the desired answer is highlighted. A message will let the user know if their guess was correct, and by entering again the next question will appear in the console. Once all of the questions have been answered, the game will end, and a score will be displayed in the console. To exit the game, key `ctrl` and `c`.

## üîÆ Future Iterations
* Update testing suite with sad path testing
* Create testing and methods to play additional rounds. This will utilize the array `Round.incorrectGuesses` and allow the user to play through the flash cards that were not answered correctly on previous rounds
